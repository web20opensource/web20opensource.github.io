## Project Overview: Stage 3, based on _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

Main page to review the project for phase 2 is: https://web20opensource.github.io/

### Specification

The project code was provided by Udacity and just I have, on top of it, updated the code to cache using IndexDB API and sails local project. 

### What do I do from here?

* Just go and review the page, navigate it. Please feel free to use a screen reader if desired and test in different mobile devices as well. DO a review from any restaurant offline/online. 

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
