Main page to review the project for phase 1 is: https://web20opensource.github.io/project_phase1/

### Specification

The project code was provided by Udacity and just I have, on top of it, updated the code to fix bugs and make it more user friendly. 

### What do I do from here?

* Just go and review the page, navigate it. Please feel free to use a screen reader if desired and test in different mobile devices as well.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
